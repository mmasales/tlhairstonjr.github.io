		<p>Tim: I’m always hype for new Pusha so this was Christmas day for me. My only concern was which Kanye we were getting outta this. The cover art is too BRZY and after finding out it’s Whitney Houston’s bathroom, my thoughts remain the same; BRZY! </p>

		
		<p class="track_title">Track 1: If You Know You Know</p>

		<p class="jake"> Jake: Clipse/Pusha undefeated when it comes to intros. Hearing that bass drop early in the morning got me hyped for the whole work day. FUCK YALL MEAN YOUR SHIT BROKE..IF YOU KNOW YOU KNOW</p>

		<p class="tim"> Tim: This the right way to open up an album w/ a damn EDM base drop and the Mobb Deep stove clicking noise in the background. Push a man of the culture, with the “Ran off on the plug 2, like Trugoy” line. Lowkey “sad” there wasn’t a Spanish dude talking wild shit throughout the song though… #petty</p>

		<p class="mo"> Mo: I like the saying “if you know you know” otherwise the track is okay, not the strongest on the album. The overly EQ’d reggae singers voice is something that I think was done better by NO I’D’s BAM track with Jay-z</p>
		
		<p class="track_title"> Track 2: The Games We Play </p>
		Jake: Man fuck Kanye..This beat bangs. It sounds like an Alchemist beat so ima just say he did it to make me feel better. Push just solidifying that he is the undisputed king of coke raps. Bringing you the best coke raps since 2002. People may have moved on to opiods and lean but not push. He said fuck all that we still here slangin’.

		Tim: Felt like The Black Goodfellas. The instrumental too fly and the Ghost/Rae Purple Tape reference was too fire

		Mo: there’s a nostalgia that horns can bring to any song. I liked this joint. I think Pusha provided the right lyrics for the music.
		
		<p class="track_title">Track 3: Hard Piano ft. Rick Ross</p>

		Jake: Notable quotable: ’For the sneaker hoarders and coke snorters” Ross forever puts out great features. Someone gotta do a compilation of just Ross features, shit would get 5 mics from the source. Beat real choppy at the end tho.

		Tim: Beat (piano) too hard like the title suggests. “Too rare around all this pink hair” line was what the culture needed. I always have high expectations w/ a Ross feature; wasn’t feeling his flow the entire verse but overall dope. Not a huge fan of chorus.

		<br>Mo: I get it. Hard piano sample and the hard piano as in hard cocaine. track is cool, not a fan of the chorus though.
		
		<p class="track_title">Track 4: Come Back Baby</p>
		<br>Jake: This the first track where you could tell Kanye produced it. I don’t hate it but I don’t love it.

		<br>Tim: Another fly bass drop w/ soulful sample. Wordplay and flow undefeated still

		<br>Mo: push the king of the Coke rap and Ye the king of the soul sample. Track proves that.

		<br>
		<p class="track_title">Track 5: Santeria</p>
		<br>Jake: This sounds like some west coast shit. Real brazy. This shit hard. That beat switch is gotdamn menacing. It’s like listening to narcos or the last scene in Training Day where Denzel tries to kill Ethan with a naked Eva Mendes chilling in the cut with her child. 

		<br>Tim: Beat wasted no time to knock setting immediate sinister tone. Felt like the next season of Narcos was starting if it set place in New Jack City. High Key wished the 1st Spanish section was shorter but last verse was heartfelt fire

		<br>Mo: track is hard. Especially the second transition
		
		<br>
		<p class="track_title">Track 6: What Would Meek Do? Ft. Kanye West  </p>
		<br>Jake: This beat fuckin bangs. Poopity scoop ass kanye being poopity kanye. Kinda feel like Pusha wrote this verse for him cuz quality is dramatically different than lift yourself.

		<br>Tim: Skeptical b/c Kanye but beat was knocking from the jump. Pusha glides on this joint. Minus that scoop w/e bull shit, Kanye got back to spittin for a second. Kinda weird though how quickly his style changed though…

		<br>Mo: to be honest, I just waited for ye’s verse. I don’t think anyone can rap over ye’s beats better than ye

		<br>
		<p class="track_title">Track 7: Infrared</p>
		
		<br>Jake: Last damn track and prolly the hardest verse on the album. Dropping venomous venom on everyone. Push holding this grudge on young money for five-ever. I don’t mind at all if it produces shit like this.EGCK FACE the whole damn time.

		<br>Tim: The Drake diss response and it didn’t disappoint. Hov and Annie verse then the Baby/Ross Beef x Wayne money issue references = Ric Flair Wwoooo! Boo to another Tom Brady reference tho…

		<br>Mo: the hardest song on the album.
